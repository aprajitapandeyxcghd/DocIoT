**IoT-Based Patient Health Monitoring System**

This project implements an IoT system using ESP8266-01 and Arduino UNO to monitor patient health metrics in real-time. It utilizes pulse and LM35 temperature sensors to collect vital data, which is accessible through a QR code-enabled Captive Portal. The system provides a seamless way to track patient health remotely and securely.
